# Jeopardy Project

## Overview
For my first project at General Assembly, I have created a Jeopardy game. When the player gets to the website they will be met with a modal that explains the rules to the game. Once they close out of the modal they will have to click the start game button for the board to become interactive. After the game is started, the player is free to choose any question in any category that they would like to answer. The player will gain points depending on the questions value and if the player earns enough points to pass the score to beat, they win the game.
